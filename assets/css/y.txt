You hate me.

You should remember how you felt when I worked for your mother and at JCP and all you wanted was a day with me.

I quit because of you. You are important to me. Even then. And still now.

I asked you honestly how you would do if you were in back to back jobs and Wednesdays were going to be your worst,

You said, you'd be fine.

So, I supported you. I know you apparently need 12 hours of sleep.  I consetantly give it to you.  It's at the expense of us.

I keep quiet, I give you eye cover, I clean and cook quietly, I do the side jobs, and I smuggle Lambeau outside.

YOU IGNORE ME.

If I am at the point where I keep you up, I am telling you.

I NEED YOU.

For more than five minutes of sex. For more than an "I appreciate you". I need you to take freaking day and do something for me. 
right now it's not going to happen, but I lay in bed with you so it's close enough.

So, I am sorry I got frustrated at you for hoping I could get your attention.
